I recently got my new laptop, a 12th gen Framework. After a couple of weeks of
use, I have some thoughts to share, because when I was shopping I thought I
thought there was a lack of information compared to other laptops available.
This post has _nothing_ to do with the face that I have had an urge to write
recently :>.

## My Laptop

I purchased a 12th gen Framework laptop with the following specs:

- CPU: _i5-1240P (Up to 4.4 GHz, 4+8 cores)_
- RAM: _32GB Corsair DDR4 3200MHz_
  - This was bought externally from Amazon as it was cheaper.
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GSTF5NJ)
- Storage: _1TB WD\_BLACK SN850_
  - This was also bought externally from Amazon as it was cheaper.
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08KFS6THF)
- Expansion Cards:
  - _1x USB C_
  - _2x USB A_
  - _1x HDMI_
  - _1x Ethernet_

Overall, I am very happy with the laptop - especially compared to my previous
Dell potato. So, let's get into my thoughts. I'm not aiming to cover everything,
I just want to cover the things I have noticed. If I have missed anything that I
deem as relevant, I will update this post.

## The Build & Design

The design of the laptop is great. It's modern and sleek, and the 4:3 screen is
excellent for productivity. I love the keyboard as well. I do, however, have a
complaint:

The expansion cards are a great idea (**sidenote: you should probably order more
than one USB C**, this is something I regret. Being able to charge from either
side is a luxury I now crave), I love that I can swap out my HDMI for an
ethernet port whenever I need. My complaint is that the cards do not sit
completely flush with the laptop - of course this is very minor and even an
expected tradeoff, but it does affect the aforementioned sleek design.
