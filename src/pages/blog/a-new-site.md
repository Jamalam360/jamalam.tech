So, yet another one! I have once again rewritten my website, this time with Astro. I think it was worth it.

## Before

This was my site before the update. I think it was too generic, with no uniqueness. It was also built entirely as a single page, and the design of it made it hard to integrate new features such as a blog.

## The Plan

My plan was initially nothing like the finished product. It was going to be a dark mode, generic Tailwind-looking site. At that point I had the idea of the terminal theme. After researching, I found a few prevalent terminal-themed website, but none of them were what I had in mind. They were inconvenient. They were a literal terminal, you had to enter commands to view content - I just wanted the theme, because no one can be bothered typing in commands to view a website.

So, with a rough idea in my head, and nothing on paper or screen, I decided to do a classic James and jump into it with poor planning. I wanted to try Astro, since everybody was talking about it on Twitter - so clearly it was amazing.
