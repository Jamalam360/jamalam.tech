  My personal terminal-themed website - the one you're on right now!
category: web
---

Going into this project, I had a few goals in mind:

- I wanted it to be unique, and more exciting than my previous site.
- I wanted it to be fast, and to load quickly.
- I wanted it to be easy to maintain, and to not have to touch the code to add new posts and projects.
- I wanted it to be fun to work on, and to be a good learning experience.
- And finally, I wanted a blog.

I think I achieved all of these goals, and I'm really happy with the result. I've learned a lot about Astro, and I'm excited to continue working with it.

## Unique

Below is a screenshot of my previous site. It was a simple, one-page site, with a few links to my socials and some basic projects. It was generic, and didn't offer me much flexibility for adding a blog and other content.

## Fast

Astro is fast. My site achieves a 100% score on Google's Lighthouse audit. Nothing more to say here.

## Easy to Maintain

My old site had projects defined in an array in JS. This time around, it's done correctly. Projects and blog posts are read from markdown, making it _so_ much simpler for me to use - and also making it possible to make blog posts.

## Fun to Work On

I had a lot of fun working on this site. Astro is a joy to use, and so is Tailwind. I am happy with this site, especially when it is compared to my old site.

## Blog

I've wanted a blog for a while now, and I'm glad I finally have one. I'm excited to write more, and to share my thoughts and ideas with the world.

## Technical Details

As mentioned, I used Astro and Tailwind to create this site. It is hosted on GitHub pages.
