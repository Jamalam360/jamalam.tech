  A Deno library to parse the Improperties file format.
category: typeScript
---

[Improperties](https://deno.land/x/improperties) is my library to parse files of the [Improperties](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Improperties-Specification) file format. Improperties is a file format that is not used, and was birthed from a shitpost on Discord - but nevertheless this library is the first that is able to pass all the unit tests defined in the specification.
