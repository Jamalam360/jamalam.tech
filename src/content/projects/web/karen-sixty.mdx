A website for my client's 60th birthday party. It takes a list of guests into a database, and generates a QR code for each guest, which they could scan to RSVP. The theming was chosen by the client, and I had to make it work with the website. The website is built with [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) and Tailwind.
