  My most downloaded mod, allowing you to harvest crops with a right click.
category: minecraft

RightClickHarvest was my first Minecraft mod, but is my most popular, having ammassed over 2 million downloads at the time of writing. It is a simple mod, but has evolved over time. It allows you to harvest crops with a right click, instead of having to break them. It is very configurable, and even allows different tier hoes to have different harvest ranges.

It is also supports a wide range of versions, from 1.14 to the latest.
